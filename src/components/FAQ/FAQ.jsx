                    <p>
                    For your <b>first order</b>: use any bag you have. Be sure to attach a note [inside] with your account
                    detail [i.e. Name + Address + Phone #]. We will provide you with your own unique laundry bag and
                    essentials for your <b>next order</b>.

                question="What if I lose the bags provided by WashMix? OR if I have more clothes
                that can fit in one bag?"
                answer={
                    <p>
                    If you run out of the counter laundry bags provided by WashMix, you can use any bag to send in your
                    order. It&apos;s always a good practice to make sure the bag used can be tightened and shut to avoid
                    items falling out. <b>IF</b> youâ€™re using any other bags than what we provide, be sure to attach a
                    note with your account detail [i.e. Name + Address + Phone #].

                    <b>YES!</b> WashMix communicates with its customers via SMS/Text. It&apos;s important that you use a
                    cell phone number, which allows you to send and receive text messages.

                question=" I live in a secure building, how do I give access to the WashMix team to access 
                my unit?"

                    <p>
                    Many buildings have a system in place to allow vendors easy access to the building or your unit.{' '}
